# Rust API Redesign Project

## Introduction

Welcome to my Rust API Redesign Project! This repository is a part of my journey to learn **Rust**, a powerful low-level programming language known for its performance and safety. The primary goal of this project is to redesign an existing API, which I originally developed in TypeScript using NestJS, by reimplementing it in Rust. This transition aims to leverage Rust's capabilities to enhance the performance and reliability of the API.

## Project Overview

The project involves rewriting a pre-existing API, initially built with TypeScript and NestJS, in Rust. Rust offers unparalleled performance and memory safety, making it an ideal choice for backend development. This rewrite serves as a hands-on approach to understand Rust's paradigms, syntax, and its ecosystem.

### Learning Objectives:

- Gain a deep understanding of Rust and its features.
- Explore popular Rust crates like `tokio` for asynchronous runtime, `serde` for serialization and deserialization, and `seaORM` for database interactions.
- Navigate and utilize documentation from crates.io and various crate documentation websites.
- Implement best practices for Rust development to ensure code efficiency and safety.

## Future Plans

Once the API rewrite is complete and stable, the next phase of this project will involve rebuilding my website using the `yew` crate, a modern Rust framework for creating multi-threaded frontend web apps with WebAssembly.

## Contributing

While this project is primarily for my learning and exploration, suggestions, and discussions are welcome! If you have insights or suggestions, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
